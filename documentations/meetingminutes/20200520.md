# Working on the list of Software Requirements

After class on evening, it turned out that the requirement should be `Architecturally significant requirements` only

More about `Architecturally significant requirements`:

* Sample: http://www.utm.mx/~caff/doc/OpenUPWeb/openup/guidances/concepts/architecturally_significant_requirements_1EE5D757.html
* From Wikipedia

> A requirement that has wide effect, targets trade-off points, is strict (constraining, limiting, non-negotiable), assumption breaking, or difficult to achieve is likely to be architecturally significant.
> 
> Indicators for architectural significance that have been reported in the literature include:
> 
> * The requirement is associated with high business value and/or technical risk.
> * The requirement is a concern of a particularly important (influential, that is) stakeholder.
> * The requirement has a first-of-a-kind character, e.g. none of the responsibilities of already existing components in the architecture addresses it.
> * The requirement has QoS/SLA characteristics that deviate from all ones that are already satisfied by the evolving architecture.
> * The requirement has caused budget overruns or client dissatisfaction in a previous project with a similar context.
> * The OpenUP[4] and Peter Eeles (IBM) discusses additional criteria for architectural significance in several articles and presentations[5]
